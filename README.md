We all know that completing tasks of clubs and chapters can be difficult, if not properly organised. Creating WhatsApp groups can help, but only to a certain extent. As we all know, due to various reasons, important messages regarding tasks can get lost in a swarm of messages (sticker spams for e.g). For this we have tried to create a web application-The taskmaster. This essentially helps in the organization of task distribution and helps the organization run more efficiently. 
The aim of our Project is to:
	To make the working of clubs and chapters more efficient online
	To keep track of tasks assigned to members of any club/chapter
	To avoid the loss of any sort of information regarding these tasks
This website can be accessed by both the board members and the core members of any club (for reference sake we have taken ISTE). 
	Different format of home page for core and board members of a club/chapter
	For the core members, a track of the tasks that have been assigned and the completion percentage of the task which has been individually assigned or assigned to the whole core
	For the board members, a  list of core members, with two buttons on the side which allows the member to view the progress or the task which has been assigned to the core member. The board members can also add tasks for the core members along with the deadline for the task
The board members will get to assign tasks either to individual core members, or they can assign common tasks. The core members can also view tasks that have been assigned to them. There will be an additional progress bar per task assigned to them which will show the percentage of how much of the task has been done. 
The main purpose of this webApp is to help organize the way tasks have been assigned and to make sure no information regarding tasks get lost.
Scope for the future:
	Mobile phone application version: which makes our project more accessible to the members of a club / chapter
	Notifications: To make sure that no member has any backlog in his task or does not receive important information on time
